# Form

Your challenge is to build out this form and get it looking as close to the design as possible using HTML ,CSS and Javascript.

## Where to find everything
The designs are in in the `/design' folder.


You will find all the required assets(images and icons) in the `/images` folder. 

Get colors, fonts etc from the `style-guide` file .

All code should be written in the `/src` folder.

## Key Notes
- Carry out client-side validation to  ensure that name, email, and token are filled in and the privacy policy checkbox is checked.

- On failed validation, the form should show which of the validations failed and displays the error.

- Submit button is only active on successful validation.
